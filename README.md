### Kelly criterion: Part 2
In this [post](https://quantdare.com/kelly-criterion-part-2/) we see how the Kelly criterion can be implemented to improve our asset allocation.

### Implementing a RNN with numpy
In this [post](https://quantdare.com/implementing-a-rnn-with-numpy/) we learn how to implement a Recurrent Neural Network from scratch using only numpy.

Check [here](https://github.com/Javicadserres/quantdare_posts/tree/master/rnn) too see how it was implemented and a usage example.

### Measuring uncertainty with RNN
In this [post](https://quantdare.com/measuring-uncertainty-in-time-series-data/) we learn how to make probabilistic forecasting with quantile predictions using the Smooth Pinball loss function in an LSTM with PyTorch.

Check [here](https://github.com/Javicadserres/quantdare_posts/tree/master/quantile-prediction) too see how it was implemented and a usage example.
